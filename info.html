        <P>  Worldwide box-office gross of over $2.8 billion, Avatar is proclaimed to be the "highest-grossing" film,
             but such claims usually refer
             to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income
             which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is 
             factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,
             in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters. While complete sales data are not available for Avatar, it earned $345 million from 
             the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.
             After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each. Television broadcast rights will also substantially add
             to a film's earnings, with a film often earning as much as 20â€“25% of its theatrical box office for a couple of television runs on top of pay-per-view
             revenues;Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights,
             equating to about 9% of its North American gross.
